## Code of conduct and team work expectations session

By the end of this session, all groups should have 2 documents to frame how they will work together:

1. Team work contract
2. Code of conduct 


## 1. Team work contract

A team work contract has a slight overlap with the code of conduct in regards to the social norms that are expected for 
contributions, but is tailored to be more specific to the core group of people who is working together and gives more detail 
about the logisitics of working together and the expectations you have for each other. For example, it may discuss what are the 
expected business/work hours for the project? How often group meetings will occur? Style of working (e.g., will you start each
day with stand-ups?). What quality of work does each team member expect from themselves and each other? When are team members
not available (e.g., evenings and Sundays because of family obligations). And many other such things.

This document does not need to go in your GitHub repo, but could instead live pinned in your team's Slack channel. It should be drafted as a team and signed by each team member to indicate agreeance. [See the bottom of this post for an example team work contract](https://agilefaq.wordpress.com/2007/11/21/what-is-a-team-ground-rule-or-team-working-agreement/)

#### Activity for building a team work contract

- Each team member needs 4 post it notes and a marker
- For 5 minutes, each team memeber will silently write out 4 different suggestions for the team work contract
- Next, as a team arrange the sticky notes on the wall and put similar suggestions together
- Each group member should then draw a dot/circle on the suggestions they support
- Spend 10 -15 minutes discussing the suggestions and decide which ones you will use for your team contract (you can of course add new ones at this point if any were missed in the earlier stages of the activity)

## 2. Code of conduct 

A Code of conduct in a Data Science project tells others how they can contribute to the project and what the social norms are for such contributions. It is more outward facing than the team work contract discussed above.

A couple key things that we think all good/effective Code of conducts cover are:
- how are people expected to communicate about and contribute to the project (e.g.,  GitHub issues, GitHub flow workflow, etc) 
- what is acceptable/not acceptable human behaviour
- what is the procedure for reporting and dealing with not acceptable human behaviour

#### Code of Conduct resources:
- Here's a link to a guide for writing these things: https://projectinclude.org/writing_cocs#
- A few good examples of Code of conducts (in our opinion):
  - http://www.idocde.net/pages/35
  - http://code-of-conduct.voxmedia.com/?_ga=1.62865454.308680892.1455143920
  - https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html (this one is too long IMHO)
