# DSCI 591: Capstone Project (2019)

__Tuesday, April 23 -- Thursday, June 27, 2019__

A mentored group project based on real data and questions from a partner within or outside the university. Students will formulate questions and design and execute a suitable analysis plan. The group will work collaboratively to produce a final product(s) to deliver to the capstone partner.


## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to:

1. Identify an interesting data science question for which data are available or obtainable.
2. Define the scope of a possible solution, identify units of work (deliverables), and estimate the effort required.
3. Design and implement a solution to a problem in data science that can be completed within 6 weeks.
4. Function effectively in teams: communicate productively between team members, identify sub-problems that could be worked on individually by team members, and integrate contributions of team members into a final product.
5. Document and present (using written, oral, and visual means) the process and results from a solution to a data science problem.
6. Evaluate or assess a solution to a data science problem, and compare it with alternative approaches. 		


## Organization of the Course

The general steps involved in this capstone course are:

1. After the Capstone fair, you will rate/rank the project proposals. You will then be assigned to a project/team. These assignments will be based mainly on the ratings but the instructors may influence the assignments in order to create teams that we think will work together effectively.
1. Meet with your MDS mentor and the Capstone partner (_before_ the course start date). Establish regular meetings.
2. __Propose__ the data product and approach. (~__2 weeks__)
    1. Work with your team, colleagues, and mentors to develop an approach in a 2-day hackathon.
    2. Orally present the proposal at UBC, to solicit ideas and feedback.
    3. Write the proposal. This will be passed to the capstone partner to check that your approach and (mostly) your proposed product is indeed in line with the capstone partner's needs.
3. __Develop__ the data product (~__6 weeks__). This involves:
    - Regular meetings with the mentor.
    - Regular meetings with the mentor and capstone partner.
4. __Polish__ the data product for delivery to your capstone partner (~__2 weeks__).
    1. Present your final data product and approach to the class.
    2. Deliver the data product after incorporating feedback from mentors and colleagues, along with a final report.
    3. Briefly present your product(s) in an end-of-program celebration (not graded).
5. __Reflect__ on the project in a short individual report.
