# Capstone Project Proposal

The proposal process is intended to set goals and directions for your capstone project. There are two (group) deliverables associated with the proposal:

- An oral presentation
- A report

Here are the steps involved in the proposal process:

1. Develop the [components of the proposal](#1-proposal-components) with your group.
2. Present the proposal to your colleagues and project Mentors.
3. Submit a draft written proposal to the project Mentor.
    - Be sure to incorporate appropriate feedback from the presentation.
4. Revise the report by incorporating feedback from your project Mentor
    - In some cases this may involve more than one round of revision.
5. After receiving permission from the project Mentor, submit the finalized proposal to the Capstone Partner and project Mentor.
    - This version of the proposal report will be graded.
6. It is recommended that you meet with your capstone partner afterwards to ensure that the goals and directions indicated in the proposal indeed align with their needs. 

## Submission Instructions
Refer to the instructions for each component of the deliverables on Canvas: https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/19091

## 1. Proposal Components

Your proposal should contain the following sections, and should be reported in this order (in both the presentation and written report). 

#### Executive Summary

A brief and high level summary of the project proposal.

#### Introduction

The introduction should start broad, introducing the question being asked/problem needing solving and why it is important. Any relevant information to understand the question/problem and its importance should be included. The proposal should communicate the question/problem  _in your own words_. This is important to show the Partner and the Mentor that you understand the question/problem.

Next, _refine_ the big-picture problem into tangible objectives that are directly addressable by data science techniques. 

Next, describe the final data product to be delivered to the partner. Example components of this product might include (but are not limited to) one or more of the following:

- A Shiny or Dash app
- A Python or R package
- A data pipeline
- Documentation

#### Data Science Techniques

Describe how you will use data science techniques in the project. Be sure to discuss the appropriateness of the data for the proposed data science techniques, as well as difficulties the data might pose. It is recommended to include a description of the data (variables/features and observational units) and some examples/snippets of what the data looks like (as a table or a visualization).

Be sure to always always start with **simple** data science techniques to obtain a simple version of your data science product. There are two benefits to this approach. First, the simple method gives you a baseline to which you can compare future results. Second, the simple method may solve the problem, in which case you don't need something more complicated. For example, your first model should not be an LSTM.

#### Timeline and Evaluation

Indicate a rough timeline of the project, including the milestones you hope to achieve.

## 2. Grading Rubric

You will receive a grade for your presentation, and the report that you submit to the capstone partner, under the following guidelines. 
All team members are expected to be involved equally in the proposal process.

#### 2.1 Presentation
rubric={reasoning:5,viz:1,presentations:3,mechanics:1}

The audience of your presentation is composed of the Mentors and your colleagues/classmates. We expect:

- Presentations to be 12 minutes or less, followed by an 8-minute question/feedback period.
- All components of the proposal to be included in the presentation.
- Your team to display excellent presentation skills, specifically:
    - speaking clearly and audibly
    - using engaging body language
    - engaging the audience, and keeping eye contact
- Your presentation is easy to follow and understand, and your team to convey the messages of the proposal effectively.
- All members of your team were active members of the presentation and following discussion.
- Your presentation to be geared towards the audience. This means using appropriate language, and knowing of their background knowledge (your audience won't know your project background).
- The presentation to be visually appealing.
- The slides to be created using a reproducible tool (e.g., Jupyter, RMarkdown or LaTeX slides) and that the source and rendered slides are submitted to the Mentor.

#### 2.2 Report
rubric={reasoning:7,viz:1,writing:1,mechanics:1}

The audience of your report is composed of:

1. Primarily, your Capstone Partner (and possibly others in their organization)
2. The project Mentor
3. Your fellow group members

From your report, we expect:

- Excellent writing, including:
    - Low-level (sentence) structure:
        - Your report is written using complete sentences and proper grammar.
        - Everything is written in your own words and you include citations where appropriate.
        - You mean what you say, and say what you mean.
        - Each sentence is necessary in communicating the message of your report.
        - The language you use must be accessible to all audiences (which is probably non-technical), but detailed enough so that you can get adequate feedback on the path you are choosing to take with the project.
    - High-level (paragraph and section) structure:
        - The organization of your report makes sense.
        - The context is properly set at all times.

The report should be concise, being mindful of your Capstone Partner's time. 2 pages maximum, 1 page is often sufficient.

#### 2.3 Proposal itself

The content of the proposal itself will be graded under the following guidelines:

- The Capstone Partner's needs (as outlined in the initial meeting with the capstone partner) have been understood.
- The Capstone Partner's needs have been refined to obtain sensible scientific objectives that are relevant and useful for addressing the capstone partner's needs.  
- The proposed products are useful.
- The proposed data science approach is thoughtful, and **starts simple**.
- The proposal evolved to its final form by adequately soliciting and using feedback from others (including Mentors, your colleagues, and possibly other statistics/computer science faculty).
- The report to be created using a reproducible tool (e.g., Jupyter, RMarkdown or LaTeX) and that the source and rendered document are submitted to the Mentor.

## 3. Helpful Hints

Here are some things to keep in mind while you go through the proposal process:

- The capstone partner may have communicated their needs as "fit model X to get results Y". This is not actually the Capstone Partner's needs. Their needs are higher level than that, and are related to having some sort of impact on their organization. An understanding of this is key to any consulting project. Ask how your Capstone Partner will be using the results in their organization.
- You're in charge when it comes to deciding on appropriate data science techniques for addressing the capstone partner's needs. If the partner suggests some methodologies, you don't have to use them (though it might be a good idea to consider what they have to say).
- Your proposed output, products, and methods will probably change throughout the capstone course. This happens for most consulting projects, and is why we have weekly high-level meetings, so that we can re-evaluate project goals and approaches. As such, don't fret about trying to perfectly predict the path you'll take on this project in the proposal.
