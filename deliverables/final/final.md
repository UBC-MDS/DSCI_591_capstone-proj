# Final deliverable

This document describes several deliverables, representing the culmination of your group's work:

### Graded
- Final report (__[Section 1](#1-final-report)__)
- Final oral presentation (__[Section 2](#2-final-presentation-at-ubc)__)
- Data Product (__[Section 3](#3-data-product)__)

### Not graded
In addition, all groups will present a summary of their project at the end-of-year celebration (__[Section 4](#4-end-of-program-presentation-some-groups)__). A selected subset of these will be short oral presentation, and all others will present as an electronic poster presentation.

You are also strongly encouraged to give a presentation at the capstone partner's organization -- see __[Section 5](#5-partner-presentation-optional-but-strongly-recommended)__.

### Steps
Here are the steps involved in the final deliverable process:

1. Deliver your oral presentation.
2. Revise your data product and report based on feedback received from the presentation. (~1 week)
3. Submit your report and data product to your mentor.
4. Revise your report and data product based on feedback received from your mentor. (~1 week)
5. Submit your report and data product to the capstone partner.
6. Share your work at the end-of-program celebration.

Descriptions of each component of the final deliverables follow.

----

## 1. Final report

The audience of your final report is primarily your capstone partner and your faculty mentor. The purpose of the report is to

- convince the capstone partner that your data product indeed addresses their needs, and
- indicate how you used data science to address the capstone partner's needs.

Try not to confuse this report with the data product -- the data product is something that your partner is intended to _use_, whereas this report is intended to justify the usefulness of your data product. 

### 1.1 Components

Your final report should contain the following sections, and should be reported in this order:

#### Executive summary
A brief and high level summary of the project proposal.

#### Introduction
The introduction should start broad, introducing the question being asked/problem needing solving and why it is important. Any relevant information to understand the question/problem and its importance should be included. This may be similar to the problem statement of the proposal, but it has most likely evolved at least a little.

Over the course of the project, you've refined the problem statement into tangible objectives that can be directly assessed by data science techniques. Indicate these refined tangible objectives here, along with your reasoning for why these scientific objectives are useful for addressing the capstone partner's needs. You might need to describe the available data first before outlining the scientific objectives.

#### Data science methods 

Next, describe the data science techniques you used to address the scientific objectives. In your discussion, you might want to include:

- Pros and cons of using this method
- Justification over other methods
- An indication of a method that might work better, or improvements one could make to your techniques. Also indicate the difficulties associated with making these improvements, and why you didn't implement the improvements.

#### Data product and results

Describe your data product and any relevant results obtained from it. For the description of the data product, you might want to include:

- How you intend the partner to use the data product
- Pros and cons of using this product/interface
- Justification over other products/interfaces
- An indication of a product/interface that might work better, or improvements one could make to your product/interface. Also indicate the difficulties associated with making these improvements, and why you didn't implement the improvements.

The description of your data product should _not_ include an indication of how to technically use the data product, nor any other documentation to your product. Such "_how-related_" topics belong with the product itself. Rather, this final report should focus on the "_why-related_" topics to communicate the purpose of the product's existence.

#### Conclusions and recommendations

Restate the question being asked/problem needing solving and explain how your data product answers/solves it. Comment on how well your product answered their question/solved their problem, and discuss any limitations of the product in its ability of doing so. Describe recommendations for the partner to continue/improve the project in the future.

### 1.2 Evaluation

You will be evaluated based on how well you refined the capstone partner's needs into scientific objectives, how effectively your data science techniques address these scientific objectives, and the appropriateness of your data product.

You will also be evaluated according to how well you communicate the usefulness of your product and scientific objectives for addressing the capstone partner's needs. The report should convince your capstone partner (or anyone in their organization) that your product is able to address their needs, and should do so concisely (without the reader to have to spend a long time reading). If there are limitations of the product in addressing the capstone partner's needs (there usually are!) these should be clearly and honestly stated. As explaination of how these limitations could be addressed in the future should also be included. 

The report should not be longer than 4 pages (excluding figures, tables and references). We recommend using an appendix or linking to GitHub/GitLab repositories if you have additional details to refer to.

Note: due to the inherent nature of the problems and available data, some Capstone projects may entail more or different challenges than others. We will take this into account when grading your projects, so that groups are not penalized for working on a specific project.

## 2. Final Presentation (at UBC)

The audience of this presentation is your classmates/colleagues and faculty mentors (the partners will not attend). The purpose is to communicate how your data product addresses your capstone partner's needs.

### 2.1 Components

Your presentation should contain the following elements, mirroring the components of the final report (of Section 1.1):

- A brief overview of the capstone partner's needs, possibly including some background if the audience is not familiar with your application area (though always keep jargon to a minimum).
- A description of the scientific objectives you ended up pursuing to address the capstone partner's needs.
- A showcasing of the data product you developed to be delivered to the capstone partner, along with:
- A description of the data science techniques making up the data product. Describe (briefly) how the technique works, if the audience is not familiar with it. Justify why your technique is appropriate (or perhaps not appropriate) for addressing the defined objectives, along with downfalls of the technique and how you might make improvements (and why you didn't).

Remember, the presentation goal is _not_ to outline what you _did_ over the capstone course. This means that it's possible (and likely) that not all of your work will be showcased. However, this doesn't mean that you can't mention techniques that weren't fruitful -- it might be useful to mention these things when justifying your data science approach.


### 2.2 Evaluation

The presentation will be graded under the following guidelines:

- Presentations are to be __22 minutes__, followed by an __8-minute__ question/feedback period.
- All components to be included in the report are included in the presentation.
- Your group displayed excellent presentation skills. You:
    - Spoke clearly and audibly
    - Had engaging body language
    - Engaged the audience, keeping eye contact
- Your presentation is easy to follow and understand. The team conveyed the messages effectively.
- All members of the team were active members of the presentation and the following discussion.
- Your presentation is geared towards the audience. This means using appropriate language, and knowing of their background knowledge (your audience won't know your project background).

### 2.3 Confidentiality

For those who have entered into confidentiality agreements with your capstone partners, you will need to give the partner an opportunity to approve the slides before presenting them to your classmates. This means you will need to have your slides finished a few business days before the presentation. You may want to let the partner know that this is coming, so that they can set aside some time to look at your work and hopefully reduce the turnaround time required.

## 3. Data Product

As a group, you will deliver a data product to your capstone partner that addresses their questions/problems/needs. This is something that is meant to be _used_ in some way.

The data product will be evaluated based on its usefulness to the client, accuracy, ease of use, readability, and interpretability. The product is expected to be packaged in a way that makes it reproducible. The exact tools for reproducibilty depend on the type of product, but all data products should **at a minimum** include a GitHub/GitLab repository containing all code necessary to recreate and test the data product, as well as a list of all software and environment dependencies (names and versions) required to create and use the data product. It should also be very well documented so that it can be both used by the client and extended by other data scientists in the future.  

## 4. End-of-year Celebration Presentations

After the final presentations, you (the MDS cohort) will rate each of the groups presentations. A small number of groups with the most highly rated presentations will be invited to give short oral presentations at the end-of-year celebration. All other groups will be invited to present an electronic poster presentation. The audience will include faculty members from the departments of statistics and computer science and capstone partners. This presentation will __not be graded__. Once again, groups with confidentiality agreements will need to have their presentation materials approved in advance; this is especially important here as the presentations/e-posters will be viewed by a wider public audience.

## 5. Partner Presentation (optional, but strongly recommended)

You may also wish to give a presentation at your capstone partner's facility to present your data science approach and data product to their organization's members. We highly recommend doing this, as it allows you to network, showcase your skills to people outside of UBC, and to potentially have a bigger impact in their organization. Ask your capstone partner if this can be arranged. Even if you do this presentation, let your capstone partner know that they are still welcome to attend the UBC end-of-program presentations.

This presentation will __not be graded__, although your mentor may want to attend as well. What you present is up to you, but you probably shouldn't make it identical to your UBC presentation. Keep the following in mind:

- __The message you want to get across__. In most cases, the main purpose is to show how your work can impact their organization. Don't just focus on the results, though -- you need to build trust that your method is more than magic, by explaining _in plain language_ how your approach works (you can be more technical in your UBC presentation). As in all presentations, you should _not_ just run through all the things you _did_ during the project, rather construct your message and select things that you did to back up your message.
- __Who the audience is__. Your audience probably knows a lot about the organization and terminology in their field, so you don't need to go over that. They also are probably not all data scientists, so don't use any data science jargon (you can use data science jargon in your UBC presentation).
